So how to make this charm to work ???

Just run `yarn` and this project good to go

### Initialize db
For using **monogodb**: create file in `./config/mongo-data.config.json` and put `uri:` field in it with your mongodb uri

For using **firebase**: download the credentials json file from firebase console and put it in `./config/<your-file>` and don't forget change `serviceAccount` import path to your file path.
*example:* from 

`import serviceAccount from "./firebase-adminsdk.json";`
